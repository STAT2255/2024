# Problem 1 (40 pts)

A professor measured the time (in seconds) required to catch a falling yard stick for 12 randomly selected students' dominant hand and nondominant hand. The professor claims that the reaction time in an individual's dominant hand is less than the reaction time in their nondominant hand. Test the claim at the $\alpha$ = 0.05 level of significance.
