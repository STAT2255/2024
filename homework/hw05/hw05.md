# Problem 1 (30 pts)

For All the methods you defined in Problems 1 and 2 of homework 4, write tests to test if they do what you expect them to do. For example, to test the `__lt__` method defined in Point class, we can do the following.

```python
import unittest
class TestMyCode(unittest.TestCase):
    def testComparatorlt(self):
        point1 = Point(3, 4)
        point2 = Point(1, 2)
        self.assertEqual(point1 < point2, False)
```


## Requirements

-   Define you own test inside the above class to test other methods you have written in Problems 1 and 2 of homework 4.
-   Create one test for each method.
-   Hint: you need to import or include the classes you defined in your homework 4.


# Problem 2 (15 points)


## part (a)

For the function define below, calculate the exact number of atomic operations that are needed as a function of n (where n is the length of input list L). Please give explainations for every term.

```python
def f(L):
    newlist = []
    for i in L: 
        if i % 2 == 0:
            newlist.append(i)
    return newlist 
```

**Hint**:

1.  Creating a empty list costs 1 atomic operation.
2.  Focus on the worst case scenario.


## part (b)

What is the running time of the function in (a) using the Big-O notation?


# Problem 3 (25 points)


## part (a)

To check if there is any duplicates in a list, we have covered 3 different solutions. Can you come up with a solution that is more efficient than them?

**Hint**: sorting a list with `L.sort` takes $n\log_{2}n$ time.


## part (b)

For `n = [800, 1600, 3200, 6400, 12800]`, use the timetrials function we defined in the notebook, calculate the running time for **duplicates2** and your function to verify that your function is indeed more efficient.
